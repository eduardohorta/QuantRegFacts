## Remarks about defense slides
1. Never go straight to heavy formulas: it is always a good idea to start with a simple example, including nice graphs to help the audience develop intuition.
2. Heavy stuff should come later. If possible, simplify notation.
3. About pace: go slowly, people need to digest what you are saying. Of course you have a lot to put out, but your presentation should be a meaningful and compelling story, not a detailed account of everything you've gone through while writing the paper/thesis/dissertation.
