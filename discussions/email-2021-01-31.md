The challenge then is to specify (analytically) a dynamics for $(Y_t, X_t)_{t\in\Z}$ that satisfies items 1-4 below:

1. the following quantile regression identity holds:
   $$
   Q_{Y_{t}}(\tau\,|\,\mathfrak{F}_{t-1}) = \alpha_0(\tau) +\sum_{j=1}^p \alpha_j(\tau) Y_{t-j} + \sum_{j=1}^q{X}_{t-j}'\beta_j(\tau)
   $$
   where $\mathfrak{F}_{t} = \sigma\big((Y_s,X_s):s\le t\big)$

2. for $j\ge1$, the maps $\tau\mapsto\alpha_j(\tau)$ and $\tau\mapsto\beta_j(\tau)$ are not necessarily constant in $\tau$.
3. $Y_t$ and $X_t$ are nonnegative and bounded.
4. $(Y_t, X_t)_{t\in\Z}$ is ergodic.

After playing around for a while, I think I have found one such dynamics (which is, I believe, also a Markov process, although I have not checked explicitly... in fact, ergodicity would be achieved only if the initial distribution of $(Y_0,X_0)$ was taken as the invariant distribution for the corresponding transition kernel). The model can be simulated as follows: for $0\le\tau\le1$, let $a(\tau) = -b(\tau) = -c(\tau) = \sqrt\tau$.

...

Notice that I am considering the QARDL dynamics without a contemporaneous $X$, but this is just a matter of relabeling the time index of the variables.

“It is important to emphasize that monotonicity of the conditional quantile functions imposes some discipline on the forms taken by the coefficients. It requires that the function $Q_{Y_t}(\tau | \mathfrak{F}_t)$ is monotone in $\tau$ in a relevant region of the $\mathfrak{F}_t$-space. In some circumstances, this necessitates restricting the domain of the dependent variables; in others, when the coordinates of the dependent variables are themselves functionally dependent, monotonicity may hold globally”
