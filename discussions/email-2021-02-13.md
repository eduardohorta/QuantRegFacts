If we're interested in a dynamics for $(X_t,Y_t)_{t\in\Z}$ on the unit square which satisfies
\begin{equation*}
Q_{Y_t}(\tau|\mathscr{F}_{t-1}) = \beta_0(\tau) + \beta_1(\tau)Y_{t-1}+\beta_2(\tau)X_{t-1},\quad \tau\in(0,1)\tag{eq. 1}
\end{equation*}
without further restrictions on the support of $(X,Y)$ as we had in the previous example, then one possibility is to consider a parametrized family of planes in $\R^3$ 
$$
p_\tau,\quad\tau\in(0,1)
$$
with the restriction that the vertices $p_\tau(0,0)$, $p_\tau(1,0)$, $p_\tau(0,1)$ and $p_\tau(1,1)$ as functions of $\tau$ are non-decreasing and have their range contained in $[0,1]$. Thus, from the perspective of modelling, it is sufficient to specify three functions, say
$$
v_{00}(\tau),\quad v_{10}(\tau),\quad v_{01}(\tau),\qquad \tau\in(0,1)
$$
satisfying the following:

1. $v_{ij}$ is non-decreasing and $\mathrm{range}(v_{ij})\subseteq[0,1]$
2. $v_{10}+v_{01}-v_{00}$ is non-decreasing and has range contained in $[0,1]$

These functions uniquely define a plane 
$$
p_\tau(u,v) = v_{00}(\tau) + [v_{10}(\tau)-v_{00}(\tau)]u + [v_{01}(\tau)-v_{00}(\tau)]v
$$
with the required properties, and then putting
$$
Q_{Y_t}(\tau|\mathscr{F}_{t-1}) = p_\tau(X_{t-1},Y_{t-1})
$$
delivers the desired QARDL model. Of course, one still needs to provide the law of $X_t$ given $(\mathscr{F}_{t-1},Y_t)$ in order to have a well defined dynamics, and nothing ensures ergodicity of the system $(X_t,Y_t)_{t\in\Z}$.

Alternatively, we can consider dynamics described by stochastic difference equations of the form
$$
Y_{t+1} = a_0 + a_1 Y_{t} + a_2 X_{t} + h(X_t,Y_t)U_{t+1},
$$
for some constants $a_0, a_1$ and $a_2$ and some sequence $(U_t)_{t\in\Z}$ of random variables, and where
$$
h(x,y) = b_0 + b_1 y + b_2 x
$$
whith $h(x,y)\ge0$ by assumption (from which one concludes that some restrictions must be placed on the support of $(X_t,Y_t)$ and on the values of $b_0, b_1$ and $b_2$, which in turn places a restriction on the support of the $U_t$'s).
Then,
$$
Q_{Y_{t+1}}(\tau|\mathscr{F}_t)=a_0 +a_1 Y_t + a_2 X_t + h(X_t,Y_t)Q_{U_{t+1}}(\tau|\mathscr{F}_t)
$$
If the $(U_t)_{t\in\Z}$ are iid with $U_{t+1}$ independent of
$\mathscr{F}_{t}$
for all $t$, and writing $q(\tau) = Q_{U_{0}}(\tau)$, we obtain then
\begin{align*}
Q_{Y_{t+1}}(\tau|\mathscr{F}_t) &= a_0 + a_1 Y_t + a_2 X_t + \big(b_0+b_1 Y_t+ b_2 X_t\big)q(\tau)\\
&= \big(a_0 + b_0q(\tau)\big) + \big(a_1 + b_1q(\tau)\big)Y_t + \big(a_2 + b_2q(\tau)\big)X_t,
\end{align*}
thus recovering (eq. 1) with $\beta_j(\tau) = a_j + b_j q(\tau)$.
