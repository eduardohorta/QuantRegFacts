Alternatively, we can consider dynamics described by stochastic difference equations of the form
$$
Y_{t+1} = a_0 + a_1 Y_{t} + a_2 X_{t} + h(X_t,Y_t)U_{t+1},
$$
for some constants $a_0, a_1$ and $a_2$ and some sequence $(U_t)_{t\in\Z}$ of random variables, and where
$$
h(x,y) = b_0 + b_1 y + b_2 x
$$
whith $h(x,y)\ge0$ by assumption (from which one concludes that some restrictions must be placed on the support of $(X_t,Y_t)$ and on the values of $b_0, b_1$ and $b_2$, which in turn places a restriction on the support of the $U_t$'s).
Then,
$$
Q_{Y_{t+1}}(\tau|\mathscr{F}_t)=a_0 +a_1 Y_t + a_2 X_t + h(X_t,Y_t)Q_{U_{t+1}}(\tau|\mathscr{F}_t)
$$
If the $(U_t)_{t\in\Z}$ are iid with $U_{t+1}$ independent of
$\mathscr{F}_{t}$
for all $t$, and writing $q(\tau) = Q_{U_{0}}(\tau)$, we obtain then
\begin{align*}
Q_{Y_{t+1}}(\tau|\mathscr{F}_t) &= a_0 + a_1 Y_t + a_2 X_t + \big(b_0+b_1 Y_t+ b_2 X_t\big)q(\tau)\\
&= \big(a_0 + b_0q(\tau)\big) + \big(a_1 + b_1q(\tau)\big)Y_t + \big(a_2 + b_2q(\tau)\big)X_t,
\end{align*}
thus recovering (eq. 1) with $\beta_j(\tau) = a_j + b_j q(\tau)$.
