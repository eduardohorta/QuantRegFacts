\item In view of the above, when the covariate vector $Z$ includes (possibly transformed) lagged values of the response, that is, in a time series framework, it is convenient (almost mandatory) to restrict attention to scenarios where all the involved random variables are bounded and non-negative, and there is no loss in generality in assuming that their support is indeed a subset of the unit interval. More precisely, suppose that one is interested in a multivariate time series $(Y_t,X_t)_{t\in\Z}$, where the $Y_t$ are scalar responses and the $X_t$ are $D$-dimensional, for which at least one of the coordinates satisfies the time homogeneous quantile regression equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq2}
Q_{Y_{t}}(\tau|\mathfrak{F}_{t-1}) = \alpha_0(\tau) + \sum_{j=1}^P \alpha_{j}(\tau) g_j(Y_{t-j}) + \sum_{\ell=1}^R \theta_\ell(\tau)X_{t-\ell},\qquad \tau\in(0,1),\,t\in\Z,
\end{equation}
for some (unknown) real valued functions $\alpha_j$, $j\in\{0,\dots,P\}$ and $\theta_\ell$, $\ell\in\{1,\dots,R\}$, some (known) functions $g_j$, $j\in\{1,\dots,P\}$ and where $\mathfrak{F}_t$ is the $\sigma$-field generated by $\big\{(Y_s,X_s)\colon \, s\le t\big\}$. In this case, the functions $g_j$ should map the real line into the unit interval to ensure the non-negative boundedness condition on the regressors; in many cases of interest (see below) we will also want to add the restriction that $\mathrm{support}(Y_t)\subseteq [0,1]$.
\item When the functions $g_1,\dots,g_P$ are all equal to the identity function, the model described in equation \eqref{eq2} is precisely the QARDL model of Galvao, Montes-Rojas and Park (2013), up to the definition of $\mathfrak{F}_t$ and inclusion of a contemporaneous $X_t$ (notice, however, that the “starting lag of $X$” is arbitrary: we can always define
$\tilde{X}_{t} = X_{t-1}$
in which case equation \eqref{eq2} includes a contemporaneous $\tilde{X}_t$). A remark: with this notation the QARDL model as introduced by these authors would have
$\sigma\big\{(Y_s,\tilde{X}_s)\colon s\le t\big\}$
in place of $\mathfrak{F}_{t-1}$, which is likely a typo since $Y_t$ behaves like a constant when conditioned on itself.
\item It is important to keep in mind that *equation \eqref{eq2} does not fully specify the dynamic behavior of the multivariate time series $(Y_t,X_t)_{t\in\Z}$*. Unlike, say, a $\mathrm{VAR}(P)$ system of stochastic difference equations — where, given some conditions on the coefficient matrix and on the inovations process, there is a unique probability law for which said difference equations hold (up to the parameters of the model) — the QARDL model is in fact a *partially specified model*, in the sense that there might be more than one probability law for $(Y_t,X_t)_{t\in\Z}$ according to which \eqref{eq2} holds: indeed, equation \eqref{eq2} says nothing about the dynamics of $(X_t)_{t\in\Z}$!
\item One can find in the literature several time series models for bounded random variables. In many cases, these fall into a fully parametric framework — hence, if one is interested in estimating the conditional quantile functions, the “correct” procedure would be to estimate the model parameters via (quasi/pseudo)maximum likelihood, and then recover the desired conditional quantile functions by pluggin in the estimated values into the (known, up to parameters) formula for the theoretical distribution. Moreover, in general these parametric models will have a conditional quantile function which is non-linear in the parameters (FAZER A CONTA PARA O $\beta$arma).

[^1]: If one adheres to a *locally concerned* interpretation of equation \eqref{eq1} --- say, assuming that the linear relationship holds only for the median, i.e. with $\tau=1/2$ --- then such restrictions do not necessarily apply. See Zheng, Peng and He (2015).
